							<h1>Local-host.co</h1>
							<p>This web-flyer provides some of the basic, early information about the next stage of a long-term project, that changes the relationship people involved have, with computing. </p>
							<p>
								<b>Local-Host is a movement</b> to develop a new form of inter-personal computing environment that is built upon a range of premise that are different to existing solutions.  In-order to participate, project participants will need to develop their own localhost and in-time,
							 	it is hoped that participants will then support the means for others to adopt a localhost environment by providing them the assistance they need to do so, and otherwise contributing towards the development of tooling to improve the ecosystems, on fair-terms. <br>
							</p>
							<p>The <b>LocalHost Ecosystem</b> has been developing to support private networking, locally hosted applications, AI & Social computing, alongside considerations about IoT.  The broader scope seems as broad as the use-casees for desktop computing</p>
							<p>There is a particular focus on seeking to support <b>Humanitarian ICT Use-Cases</b>, which in-turn considers various <b>Human Rights</b> considerations, including but not limited to those relating to children.</p>
							<p>A Local Host Environment enables owners to set-up their own computing environment, that is then connected to their devices that are then able to operate privately, socially and otherwise via <b>Internet</b> based networking</p>

									<h2>Foundations - Workstation Basics</h2>
									<p>Whilst there are various 'new' options out there, they are very, very expensive. The suggestion for those interested in getting involved in helping to create this ecosystem now, is to use 2nd hand parts & help build the ecosystem.</p>
									<p>It is suggested that a 2nd hand DUAL XEON based system with a minimum of 24 Cores (48 threads), 256GB RAM (512+GB Recommended) in a form-factor that has MORE THAN 4 x16 PCIe Slots & a PSU Rated at over 1400w.</p>
									<p>there are a variety of specific technical considerations relating to the purpose of these machines, in particular relating to support requirements for AI related software & community members are actively interested in sharing knowledge about these sorts of considerations in the local-host community.</p>

									<h2>GPU</h2>
									<p>It is Recommended that systems use Modern nVidia Hardware with at least 72GB of vRAM (video ram).  This can be achieved via Multiple Cards. Whilst community help is available to learn about the considerations, it is otherwise important to be considerate of the amount of power, heat, PCIe Slots (/space) & connectors are available in your system.</p> 
									<p><i>Improved support for Intel & AMD based GPUs and Mac M series Processors is desirable, but is scheduled as a future objective in the roadmap.</i></p>

									<h2>Storage & Networking</h2>
									<p>It is recommended that the machine be configured with at least <b>2TB of Fast Storage</b> for <b>Applications & Operating System</b> purposes, and a <b>RAID-5 Array with 30TB</b> of storage (usable volume) available.</p>
									<p><b>Networking Locally</b> should be via high-speed Wireless or Wired Connectivity, with a WAN connection (internet) of at least 18Mbps Symmetrical (100Mbps/40Mbps & greater is preferred).</p>
									<p>A <b>Domain Name</b> and a <b>VPS Host</b> with nominal specifications but a large amount of bandwidth is also presently required.</p>

							<h2>Software</h2>
							<p>The project basically works to develop a new type of operating system. Historically, there's been many names, whether it be a 'network based operating system' or 'interpersonal computing', the name doesn't matter as much as whether or not it works, is useful, safe, awesome, etc. </p>
							<p>So, one of the bigger challenges at the moment, is to now go through and assemble the <b>Standard Operating Environment</b> specification and related tooling, integration, work - so that deploying these systems can be done more easily, more cheaply and that newbies have someone local who can support their support needs.</p>

									<h3>Development</h3>
									<p>We're actively looking for people interested in helping to build-out a new type of computing platform, that both, acts to support human rights & deliver Humanitarian ICT without every keystroke being consumed by platform reprobates, and to then, deliver new types of previously impossible, computing related capabilities, experiences and opportunities to change our relationship with Advanced Technology.</p>

							<h2>Get involved.</h2>
							<p>If you want to get involved, the suggestion is that you reach-out via <a href="https://keybase.io/team/local_host">Keybase</a>.  We are working towards 'deplatforming' outselves as part of the immediate critical path, and will provide more links once the've been set-up on our local-host environment(s).</p>
							<p>There's no place like 127.0.0.1.  But Whether its about whose invited to be involved, or when you're out or how to make safer and better computing environments for your home, your life and your kids - gotta start somewhere... </p>
							<p>So, this flyer - its intended to be simple - as the work otherwise, the output - the objective - is to make it available via our LocalHost solutions</p>
